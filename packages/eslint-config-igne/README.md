# Eslint configs for Igne agency

Currently contains config that can be used for SPA projects, made with Vite or CRA.

## TODO

- Test the current TS implementation (overrides) in a Vite TS project
- `eslint-plugin-simple-import-sort`
- Put rules in separate files, one per plugin/feature, so they can be included per stack config file
- Make stack specific exports: Expo, NextJS, (and typescript for each as well)

Investigate:

- eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y (this may have significant impact on existing projects)
